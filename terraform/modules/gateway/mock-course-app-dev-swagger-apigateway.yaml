                \ perhaps, a very basic text editor (e.g., ed) and an assembler program.\

                \ a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one\

                Historically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for\
                \ computer program development on new hardware. The technique described\
                \ in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a cross compiler\
                \ executed by a pre-existing computer. Bootstrapping in program development\
                \ began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper\
                \ in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because\
                \ there was no high-level computer language, no compiler, no assembler,\
                \ and no linker. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new\
                \ computer (for example the IBM 650) which converted a few instructions\
                \ into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was\
                \ then rewritten in its just-defined assembly language but with extensions\
                \ that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more\
                \ complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program\
                \ was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary\
                \ or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those\
                \ enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded,\
                \ branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences\
                \ (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established.\
                \ This was how the early assembly program SOAP (Symbolic Optimal Assembly\
                \ Program) was developed. Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities\
                \ were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping\
